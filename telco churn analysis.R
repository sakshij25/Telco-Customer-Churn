## "Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

## Content
## Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer's attributes described on the column Metadata.

## The data set includes information about:
        
##       Customers who left within the last month - the column is called Churn
## Services that each customer has signed up for - phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
## Customer account information - how long they've been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
## Demographic info about customers - gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
## Inspiration
## To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

## we need to find out how many customers r ready to churn
